    <div class="text-sm font-semibold w-1/2">Many college CS students are very lonely because they spend all of their time coding and donâ€™t have time to find love. GitMatched will let students post code snippets and will then use a code similarity algorithm to let students connect with a special someone who has a similar coding style. We make it easy for coders to find not just a new coding partner but also true love without having to do any extra work!</div>
